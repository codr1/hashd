# HASHD Project Instructions

- Use `uv run python` to run Python commands (not .venv/bin/python or system python)
- Don't use emojis
- Imports belong on top of files unless there is a circular dependency
- Do not add defensive programming around potentially missing imports - if it's in requirements.txt, it's installed
- Don't overengineer initially - check with the user before adding extra bells and whistles
- We are in initial implementation - no migrations needed, ask before adding backward compatibility
- Do not include bylines in your commit messages
- Do not try to commit without being explicitly instructed by a human to do so
